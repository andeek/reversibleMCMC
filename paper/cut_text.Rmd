### Delayed Rejection

Finally, there is a technique called delayed rejection. Essentially, if proposal $x'$ is rejected, a backup proposal $x''$ is immedeatly proposed, with an acceptance probability that takes into account the rejection of the first proposal to maintain the desired stationary distribution.  This literally increases the likelihood of acceptance and thus the overall efficiency of the sampler. This technique has interesting implications to the interplay between the first and second proposal, specifically selecting a distribution for which cross model proposals are generated frequently as the first proposal, with a proposal that assigns higher weight inside a model as the backup. This allows us to attempt to change state space frequently without being stuck on the same initial state for multiple iterations.
