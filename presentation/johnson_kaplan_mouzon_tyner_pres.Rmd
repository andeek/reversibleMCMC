## Reversible Chain

  - Definition
  - Animation
  - Detailed balance condition

## Algorithm
This may be moved to paper only, depending on time/detail required

# Example

## Poisson/Negative Binomial Model

# Challenges for implementation

## The Challenges Aren't What You Think

Implementing reversible algorithms may seem difficult for several reasons. 
- Much of the work being reported is from the perspective of MCMC "experts"
- The language required to present these samplers is necessarily complex

These issues are not the cause of difficulty though
- In the practical sense, implementation is *actually* fairly easy 
- Very few areas require a detailed understanding of the underlying theorhetical framework 
- There is little justification needed to garuntee a sampler is able to simulate from a target

## Efficiency

The main issue is usually not whether a proposal mechanism will work, 
but whether it will work effeciently.

- Ineffecient chains are slow to explore the support of the target distribution
- Taking more *time* to converge to the target distribution

Improving efficiency requires the posterior of the proposed state $(k', \theta'_{k'})$ 
and the posterior of the existitng state $(k, \theta_k)$ to be similar.

The tuning for a specific problem can be arduous, leading to the following general
approaches

  - Adaptive RJMCMC 
  - Interacting Sequential MCMC
  - Simulated Annealing extended for trans-dimensionsal problems

<div class="notes">
  - Efficiency gains - adaptive sampling. Idea: proposal mechanisms may be allowed to depend on past realizations of the chain, not just current state without invalidating ergodicity of process. Optimal location and scaling of proposal can be determined during run, eliminating tuning.
  - ISMC - Several sequential MC samplers run in parallel, separate subspaces. For each sampler at time $t < T$, particles updated using (reversible) MCMC moves. When a oredetermined time $t^* < T$ is reached, the separate samplers are combined into a single sampler moving across all models.
  - Simulated annealing where an optimal model may need to be determined. I.e., function $f$ quantity to minimize with some penalization terms. Trans-dimensional simulated annealing proceeds by using reversible jump moves to construct a Markov chain with appropriate invariant dsn. Once equilibrium achieved, temperature is decreased and new phase is started from the state the chain ended in.
