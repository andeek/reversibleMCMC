## Reversible Chain

  - Definition
  - Animation
  - Detailed balance condition

## Algorithm
This may be moved to paper only, depending on time/detail required

# Example

## Poisson/Negative Binomial Model

# Challenges for implementation
While the language used to describe this method can be complicated, 
people who work with reversible jump methods promise that promise that 
it is actually very simple to employ and a full understanding of the 
method is not neccessary.
